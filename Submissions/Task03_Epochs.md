# Task 3 - Epochs
- the overfitting started slightly with 10 epochs but increased as we increased the number of epochs to 20
#### how adam optimizer influenced speed and stability of convergence
- by using adaptive learning rate and momentum which increases the speed of convergence
- bias correction and helping avoiding overshooting is what makes it stable
