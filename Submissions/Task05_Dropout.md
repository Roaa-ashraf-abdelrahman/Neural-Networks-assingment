# Task 5 - Dropout
## conclusion
- without dropout, overfitting level was very high
- as we add drop out layer, overfitting decreases
- when dropout was set to 0.3, it reduced overfitting a alot
- Co-adaptation is when neurons come together to extract the same or very similar patterns to each other, that leads to wasted computing resources and makes the model focus more on those features, so dropout reduces this process, leading to robustness
